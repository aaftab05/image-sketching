# image-sketching
This project is a web-based application that converts normal photographs into artistic outputs such as Pencil Sketch, Watercolor Painting, and Cartoon Illustration, along with an Image Clarity Enhancement feature. It is built using Python, Streamlit, and OpenCV, combining traditional image-processing algorithms with a simple and interactive UI.
