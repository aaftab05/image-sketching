#Image to Sketch & Artistic Style Converter

A Streamlit-powered application that transforms normal photographs into artistic visuals such as Pencil Sketch, Watercolor Painting, and Cartoon Illustration, along with an Image Clarity Enhancement feature. Built using Python and OpenCV, the system offers an intuitive interface for instant image-to-art conversion.

##🌟 Overview

This project converts standard images into multiple artistic styles using advanced OpenCV techniques such as edge detection, bilateral filtering, stylization filters, and unsharp masking. Users can upload images or capture them directly from the webcam through a clean Streamlit interface. Adjustable parameters allow fine control over each style, making the tool useful for creative projects, educational demos, and quick image enhancements.
